Fuga has three version numbers.

The first is the major version number. This denotes significant language
changes, backward-compatibility breaking changes, or a gestalt of all
revisions and minor changes into a single, neat package.

The second number, after the dot, is the minor version number. This
denotes smaller changes to the language, including small
backward-compatibility breaking changes. In general, this is used
to introduce new features.

The third number is actually a letter -- the revision letter. Typically,
a new release of Fuga will have its flaws. The revision letter goes up
as attempts are made to improve the quality or completeness of the
current release. The letter is also used for bugfixes. Note that this
system is different from the 'alpha', 'beta', etc system. The letters
don't really imply anything about the finishedness of a release.

The Fuga language only has major/minor numbers. The revision letter is
intended to specify the current interpreter or specification release. The
language between letters is the same. This means that actual language
changes must involve bumping the version number.
