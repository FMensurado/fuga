[Oct 6 2010] FM: Add var() / Var.
[Oct 5 2010] FM: Stop representing exprs as lists. Lists are a little
 heavy for this task -- either simplify the lists, or make expr its
 own kind of object.
[Oct 5 2010] FM: Conc lists don't really harness the object structure too
 well. Perhaps some B-Tree like lists would work better (i.e., we have
 a 'depth' slot, and the other slots are nodes).
[Oct 5 2010] FM: List mapReduce, List reduce, List filter...
[Oct 5 2010] FM: Number to would be nice.
[Oct 5 2010] FM: There should be some way of specifying right-sending
 operators, and operators that send to scope.
[Oct 5 2010] FM: Do I need right-associative operators? Yes. For example,
 a +> b (List cons_left).
