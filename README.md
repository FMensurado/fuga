# Fuga

This is the (main) interpreter for the programming language, Fuga. The
interpreter is also known as Fuga. The interpreter can be used as a
standalone interpreter for Fuga, or it can be used in other
applications.

## To Build

Use `make`:

    $ make

## To Run

The executable file is `fuga`. However, to run it properly, you must
use tools/try:

    $ tools/try

This opens up an interactive interpreter. To run a Fuga file, specify
the filename:

    $ tools/try filename.fg
